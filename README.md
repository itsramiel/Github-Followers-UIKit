# Github Followers App with UIKit

As part of my learning of iOS development, I followed Sean Allen's [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzngncpZLuw&t=42984s) to build this app.
It helped me put theory into practice, and I was able to practice network calling, auto layout, and screen navigations which are building blocks of every iOS app.
